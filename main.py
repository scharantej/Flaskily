    return render_template('result.html', result=result)

# Define the function to perform the necessary calculations

I have made the following assumptions:

- The function `calculate_something()` performs the necessary calculations based on the problem statement. You need to replace this function with your actual implementation.
- The HTML files `index.html` and `result.html` are created separately and placed in the templates folder of your Flask application.
- The necessary CSS file for styling is also created separately and placed in the static folder of your Flask application.

Please let me know if you have any further questions.
